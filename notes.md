The `Array.from(new Set(...))` is used to ensure that you are extracting unique categories from the data.

Here's why:

- `data.products.map((product) => product.category)` creates an array of all the categories from the products, but this array can contain duplicates if multiple products belong to the same category.
- `new Set()` is used to remove duplicates because a Set only stores unique values.

- `Array.from()` is used to convert the Set back into an array, as the `Set` object doesn't have all the array methods you might want to use later (like `.map()`, `.forEach()`, etc.).

Without `Array.from(new Set(...))`, you would get an array with potentially many repeated categories. If you only use `data.products.map(...)`, you'll end up with all categories (including duplicates). This approach gives you a clean list of unique categories for filtering or displaying purposes.
